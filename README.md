We follow a systematic Git Workflow -

- Create a fork of this repo.
- Clone your fork of your repo on your pc.
- [Add Upstream to your clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
- **Every change** that you do, it has to be on a branch. Commits on master would directly be closed.
- Make sure that before you create a new branch for new changes,[syncing with upstream](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) is neccesary.

**Commits**

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [this](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)).
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check [this](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) for more info)
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
